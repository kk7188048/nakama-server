# Nakama Tic-Tac-Toe Server â€” Architecture & Design

## Purpose
A compact Nakama-based backend for Tic-Tac-Toe providing authentication, matchmaking, real-time gameplay, and leaderboards for multiple users.

## Core Components
- Nakama server (runtime)
  - Real-time multiplayer via sockets
  - Non-real-time APIs for admin, stats, and data
  - Server-side scripts for custom game logic
- PostgreSQL/Neon database
  - Persistent storage for users, stats, and leaderboards
- Client(s)
  - Frontend apps connecting with Nakama client
  - Auth, matchmaking, gameplay, and leaderboard UI
- Deployment
  - Containerized Nakama server
  - Frontend hosted separately (optional)

## Data Model (Key Entities)
- Users: accounts, usernames, tokens
- Matches: live game state (board, moves, turns, winner)
- Leaderboards: wins (score), total games (subscore), rank, metadata
- Game events: game_start, board_update, game_over

## Workflows

- Authentication
  - Client authenticates a device/user; server issues and validates sessions
- Matchmaking & Gameplay
  - Players join a matchmaker; server starts a match and broadcasts real-time updates
  - Moves are validated by the server and broadcast to both players
  - On win/draw, server broadcasts game_over with winner info
- Leaderboard
  - Server tracks wins and total games
  - Client reads leaderboard; win rate derived as wins / total games


## Observability & Maintenance
- Centralized logging and health checks
- Monitor with metrics and alerts
- Regular backups of database
- Versioned deployments and rollback capability

## Deployment Outline (High Level)
- Build server modules (TypeScript used)
- Configure Nakama with a robust database URL as Online Neon Database used
- Containerize (Docker) or deploy via a cloud platform
- Used Render for Nakama Server and Vercel for Client side
